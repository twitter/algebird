 * (a cache, for example). This allows the code handing over the
 * elements (in this case, Tunnel objects) to depend on the result
 * of the HasAdditionOperatorAndZero's computation. Note that this code does not depend
 * on any particular HasAdditionOperatorAndZero -- that dependency is strictly when the Tunnel
 * objects are created. This is the async analogue of Function1HasAdditionOperatorAndZero.
