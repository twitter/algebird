/**
 * A useful utility for aggregation systems: you buffer up some number of items
 * in a thread-safe way, and when you have at most K of them, you sum them all
 * together.  A good use-case of this is doing a limited preaggregation before
 * sending on to a next phase (from mappers to reducers on Hadoop, or between
 * storm bolts).
 *
 * Without this finite buffer history, an aggregated item could build up infinite
 * history, and therefore it is unbounded in the error you could introduce by
 * losing the buffer.
