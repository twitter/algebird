/**
 * This is a typeclass to represent things which increase. Note that it is important
 * that a value after being incremented is always larger than it was before. Note
 * that next returns Option because this class comes with the notion of the "greatest"
 * key, which is None. Ints, for example, will cycle if next(java.lang.Integer.MAX_VALUE)
 * is called, therefore we need a notion of what happens when we hit the bounds at
 * which our ordering is violating. This is also useful for closed sets which have a fixed
 * progression.
