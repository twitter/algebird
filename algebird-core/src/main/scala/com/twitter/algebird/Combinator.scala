/**
 * This is a combinator on semigroups, after you do the plus, you transform B with a fold function
 * This will not be valid for all fold functions. You need to prove that it is still associative.
 *
 * Clearly only values of (a,b) are valid if fold(a,b) == b, so keep that in mind.
 *
 * I have not yet found a sufficient condition on (A,B) => B that makes it correct
 * Clearly a (trivial) constant function {(l,r) => r} works.
 * Also, if B is List[T], and (l:A,r:List[T]) = r.sortBy(fn(l))
 * this works as well (due to the associativity on A, and the fact that the list never loses data).
 *
 * For approximate lists (like top-K applications) this might work (or be close enough to associative
 * that for approximation algorithms it is fine), and in fact, that is the main motivation of this code:
 * Produce some ordering in A, and use it to do sorted-topK on the list in B.
 *
 * Seems like an open topic here.... you are obliged to think on your own about this.
