/**
 * The Count-Min sketch uses `d` (aka `depth`) pair-wise independent hash functions drawn from a universal hashing
 * family of the form:
 *
 * `h(x) = [a * x + b (mod p)] (mod m)`
 *
 * As a requirement for using CMS you must provide an implicit `CMSHasher[K]` for the type `K` of the items you want to
 * count.  Algebird ships with several such implicits for commonly used types `K` such as `Long` and [[scala.BigInt]].
 *
 * If your type `K` is not supported out of the box, you have two options: 1) You provide a "translation" function to
 * convert items of your (unsupported) type `K` to a supported type such as [[Double]], and then use the `contramap`
 * function of [[CMSHasher]] to create the required `CMSHasher[K]` for your type (see the documentation of `contramap`
 * for an example); 2) You implement a `CMSHasher[K]` from scratch, using the existing CMSHasher implementations as a
 * starting point.

  /**
   * =Implementation details=
   *
   * This hash function is based upon Murmur3.  Note that the original CMS paper requires
   * `d` (depth) pair-wise independent hash functions;  in the specific case of Murmur3 we argue that it is sufficient
   * to pass `d` different seed values to Murmur3 to achieve a similar effect.
   *
   * To seed Murmur3 we use only `a`, which is a randomly drawn `Int` via [[scala.util.Random]] in the CMS code.
   * What is important to note is that we intentionally ignore `b`.  Why?  We need to ensure that we seed Murmur3 with
   * a random value, notably one that is uniformly distributed.  Somewhat surprisingly, combining two random values
   * (such as `a` and `b` in our case) typically worsens the "randomness" of the combination, i.e. the combination is
   * less uniformly distributed as either of its original inputs.  Hence the combination of two random values is
   * discouraged in this context, notably if the two random inputs were generated from the same source anyways, which
   * is the case for us because we use Scala's PRNG only.
   *
   * For further details please refer to the discussion
   * [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3956478/understanding-randomness Understanding Randomness]] on
   * StackOverflow.
   *
   * @param a Must be a random value, typically created via [[scala.util.Random]].
   * @param b Ignored by this particular hash function, see the reasoning above for the justification.
   * @param width Width of the CMS counting table, i.e. the width/size of each row in the counting table.
   * @param x Item to be hashed.
   * @return Slot assigned to item `x` in the vector of size `width`, where `x in [0, width)`.
