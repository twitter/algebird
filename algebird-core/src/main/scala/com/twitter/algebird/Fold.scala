/**
 * Folds are first-class representations of "Traversable.foldLeft." They have the nice property that
 * they can be fused to work in parallel over an input sequence.
 *
 * A Fold accumulates inputs (I) into some internal type (X), converting to a defined output type
 * (O) when done.  We use existential types to hide internal details and to allow for internal and
 * external (X and O) types to differ for "map" and "join."
 *
 * In discussing this type we draw parallels to Function1 and related types. You can think of a
 * fold as a function "Seq[I] => O" but in reality we do not have to materialize the input sequence
 * at once to "run" the fold.
 *
 * The traversal of the input data structure is NOT done by Fold itself. Instead we expose some
 * methods like "overTraversable" that know how to iterate through various sequence types and drive
 * the fold. We also expose some internal state so library authors can fold over their own types.
 *
 * See the companion object for constructors.
