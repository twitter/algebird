/**
 * A Count-Min sketch is a probabilistic data structure used for summarizing
 * streams of data in sub-linear space.
 *
 * It works as follows. Let `(eps, delta)` be two parameters that describe the
 * confidence in our error estimates, and let `d = ceil(ln 1/delta)`
 * and `w = ceil(e / eps)`.
 *
 * Note: Throughout the code `d` and `w` are called `depth` and `width`,
 * respectively.
 *
 * Then:
 *
 * - Take `d` pairwise independent hash functions `h_i`, each of which maps
 *   onto the domain `[0, w - 1]`.
 * - Create a 2-dimensional table of counts, with `d` rows and `w` columns,
 *   initialized with all zeroes.
 * - When a new element x arrives in the stream, update the table of counts
 *   by setting `counts[i, h_i[x]] += 1`, for each `1 <= i <= d`.
 * - (Note the rough similarity to a Bloom filter.)
 *
 * As an example application, suppose you want to estimate the number of
 * times an element `x` has appeared in a data stream so far.
 * The Count-Min sketch estimate of this frequency is
 *
 *   min_i { counts[i, h_i[x]] }
 *
 * With probability at least `1 - delta`, this estimate is within `eps * N`
 * of the true frequency (i.e., `true frequency <= estimate <= true frequency + eps * N`),
 * where N is the total size of the stream so far.
 *
 * See http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/CS222/countmin.pdf for technical details,
 * including proofs of the estimates and error bounds used in this implementation.
 *
 * Parts of this implementation are taken from
 * https://github.com/clearspring/stream-lib/blob/master/src/main/java/com/clearspring/analytics/stream/frequency/CountMinSketch.java

/**
 * HasAdditionOperatorAndZero for adding [[CMS]] sketches.
 *
 * =Usage=
 *
 * `eps` and `delta` are parameters that bound the error of each query estimate. For example, errors in
 * answering point queries (e.g., how often has element x appeared in the stream described by the sketch?)
 * are often of the form: "with probability p >= 1 - delta, the estimate is close to the truth by
 * some factor depending on eps."
 *
 * The type `K` is the type of items you want to count.  You must provide an implicit `CMSHasher[K]` for `K`,  and
 * Algebird ships with several such implicits for commonly used types such as [[Long]] and [[BigInt]]:
 *
 * {{{
 * import com.twitter.algebird.CMSHasherImplicits._
 * }}}
 *
 * If your type `K` is not supported out of the box, you have two options: 1) You provide a "translation" function to
 * convert items of your (unsupported) type `K` to a supported type such as [[Double]], and then use the `contramap`
 * function of [[CMSHasher]] to create the required `CMSHasher[K]` for your type (see the documentation of [[CMSHasher]]
 * for an example); 2) You implement a `CMSHasher[K]` from scratch, using the existing CMSHasher implementations as a
 * starting point.
 *
 * Note: Because Arrays in Scala/Java not have sane `equals` and `hashCode` implementations, you cannot safely use types
 * such as `Array[Byte]`.  Extra work is required for Arrays.  For example, you may opt to convert `Array[T]` to a
 * `Seq[T]` via `toSeq`, or you can provide appropriate wrapper classes.  Algebird provides one such wrapper class,
 * [[Bytes]], to safely wrap an `Array[Byte]` for use with CMS.
 *
 * @param eps One-sided error bound on the error of each point query, i.e. frequency estimate.
 * @param delta A bound on the probability that a query estimate does not lie within some small interval
 *        (an interval that depends on `eps`) around the truth.
 * @param seed  A seed to initialize the random number generator used to create the pairwise independent
 *        hash functions.
 * @tparam K The type used to identify the elements to be counted.  For example, if you want to count the occurrence of
 *           user names, you could map each username to a unique numeric ID expressed as a `Long`, and then count the
 *           occurrences of those `Long`s with a CMS of type `K=Long`.  Note that this mapping between the elements of
 *           your problem domain and their identifiers used for counting via CMS should be bijective.
 *           We require a [[CMSHasher]] context bound for `K`, see [[CMSHasherImplicits]] for available implicits that
 *           can be imported.
 *           Which type K should you pick in practice?  For domains that have less than `2^64` unique elements, you'd
 *           typically use [[Long]].  For larger domains you can try [[BigInt]], for example.  Other possibilities
 *           include Spire's `SafeLong` and `Numerical` data types (https://github.com/non/spire), though Algebird does
 *           not include the required implicits for CMS-hashing (cf. [[CMSHasherImplicits]].

   * This hash function is based upon Murmur3.  Note that the original CMS paper requires

   * to pass `d` different seed values to Murmur3 to achieve a similar effect.
   *
   * To seed Murmur3 we use only `a`, which is a randomly drawn `Int` via [[scala.util.Random]] in the CMS code.
   * What is important to note is that we intentionally ignore `b`.  Why?  We need to ensure that we seed Murmur3 with
   * a random value, notably one that is uniformly distributed.  Somewhat surprisingly, combining two random values
   * (such as `a` and `b` in our case) typically worsens the "randomness" of the combination, i.e. the combination is
   * less uniformly distributed as either of its original inputs.  Hence the combination of two random values is
   * discouraged in this context, notably if the two random inputs were generated from the same source anyways, which
   * is the case for us because we use Scala's PRNG only.
   *
