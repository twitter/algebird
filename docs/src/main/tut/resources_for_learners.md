## Books

- [Notes on Abstract Algebra](http://www.math.usm.edu/perry/old_classes/mat423fa11/notes_25aug2011.pdf) by University of Southern Mississipi professor [John Perry](http://www.math.usm.edu/perry/)
- [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason - While this book does not specifically cover Algebird, it's a great introduction to functional programming in Scala in general and covers some of the abstractions that can be found in Algebird.
