### Overview

Abstract algebra for Scala. This code is targeted at building aggregation systems (via [Scalding](https://github.com/twitter/scalding) or [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/)). It was originally developed as part of Scalding's Matrix API, where Matrices had values which are elements of Monoids, Groups, or Rings. Subsequently, it was clear that the code had broader application within Scalding and on other projects within Twitter.

See the [Algebird website](https://twitter.github.io/algebird) for more information.

### What can you do with this code?

```scala
> sbt algebird-core/console

Welcome to Scala 2.12.12 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 11.0.1).
Type in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.

scala> import com.twitter.algebird._
import com.twitter.algebird._

scala> import com.twitter.algebird.Operators._
import com.twitter.algebird.Operators._

scala> Map(1 -> Max(2)) + Map(1 -> Max(3)) + Map(2 -> Max(4))
res0: scala.collection.immutable.Map[Int,com.twitter.algebird.Max[Int]] = Map(2 -> Max(4), 1 -> Max(3))
```

In the above, the class `Max[T]` signifies that the `+` operator should actually be `max` (this is accomplished by providing an implicit instance of a typeclass for `Max` that handles `+`).

- Model a wide class of "reductions" as a sum on some iterator of a particular value type. For example, average, moving average, max/min, set union, approximate set size (in much less memory with HyperLogLog), approximate item counting (using CountMinSketch).
- All of these combine naturally in tuples, vectors, maps, options and more standard scala classes.
- Implementations of Monoids for interesting approximation algorithms, such as Bloom filter, HyperLogLog and CountMinSketch. These allow you to think of these sophisticated operations like you might numbers, and add them up in hadoop or online to produce powerful statistics and analytics.
